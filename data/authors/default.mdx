### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Carter Speerschneider—an aspiring security engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I'm an active member of the Whitehatter Computer Security Club (WCSC), where I explore Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and penetration testing techniques. I’ve already earned the CompTIA Security+ certification and plan to pursue the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) next to deepen my understanding of networking and security fundamentals.

### Passions
Before college, I was drawn to programming and mathematics, which led me to choose Computer Science as my major. One of my favorite courses has been Discrete Mathematics, thanks to its focus on theorems and proofs. I consider myself an abstract thinker, which helps me approach practical problems with creativity and logic.
Prior to shifting my focus to cybersecurity, I spent time honing my skills in algorithms and data structures through platforms like LeetCode. This experience reshaped how I tackle complex challenges and strengthened my problem-solving mindset. My goal is to apply these skills to make a meaningful impact in the security industry—protecting systems, data, and people.
