## About the Author

I'm Carter, a Computer Science major transitioning from software engineering to cybersecurity. I started learning to code at 17 while still in high school, driven by a passion for understanding how computers work at a fundamental level. While I love programming and see myself coding for life, I've found my calling in cybersecurity—a field that allows me to dive deep into technical systems while maintaining the problem-solving creativity that first drew me to technology.
